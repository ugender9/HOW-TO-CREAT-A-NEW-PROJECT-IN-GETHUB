Project: Text Generation AI - Next Word Prediction in Python

Overview

This mission is a textual content technology AI that predicts the next phrase in a sequence of textual content using a deep getting to know version. The version is skilled on a dataset of text and makes use of a mixture of herbal language processing (NLP) and machine mastering techniques to generate textual content.

Code Structure

The code is prepared into numerous sections:

Data Preprocessing: The code hundreds a dataset of text and preprocesses it by tokenizing the textual content, converting it to lowercase, and growing a vocabulary of particular words.
Model Definition: The code defines a deep gaining knowledge of model the use of the Keras library, which consists of numerous layers such as LSTM and Dense layers.
Model Training: The code trains the version at the preprocessed statistics the usage of a custom schooling loop.
Model Evaluation: The code evaluates the performance of the model using metrics together with accuracy and loss.
Text Generation: The code defines a characteristic to generate textual content the use of the skilled version, which takes an input series of text and predicts the next phrase.
How to Use

To use this undertaking, virtually run the code in a Python environment with the required libraries mounted (e.G. Keras, TensorFlow, NumPy, and many others.). You can modify the hyperparameters and structure of the version to improve its performance.

Results

The undertaking includes several examples of generated textual content using the educated version. The effects display that the version is capable of generate coherent and context-based text.

Future Work

There are numerous areas for future improvement, consisting of:

Increasing the scale and variety of the education dataset
Experimenting with distinct version architectures and hyperparameters
Improving the assessment metrics and methodology
Integrating the model with other NLP responsibilities
